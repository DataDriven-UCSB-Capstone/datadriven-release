🎉 June 8th, 2023 (Capstone Day) Update:

**🏆 Distinguished Technical Achievement in CE (2nd Place)**

Thank you so much Professor Yoga, the TAs, CE faculty, organizers, and our sponsor CACI! This year-long project has been an invaluable learning experience to collaborate as a team on an ambitious HW/SW project from designing a PCB to deploying a highly modular and extensible full-stack web app and API.

As the project comes to an end, this about page will still be active but the AWS backend infrastructure for the web app will be shut down soon. Feel free to check out the demo video to see our system in action!

Thanks again,

\- the DataDriven team (Hyun Kyum Kim, Brian Li, Bryan Olivares, Nicholas Tran, Arjun Vinod)

## 🎬 System Overview & Demo

🚙 Vehicles are expensive investments – they need routine maintenance and constant upkeep to avoid costly repairs. At scale, this becomes a complex logistical challenge. Failures can be costly to the fleet owner in vehicle downtime for unexpected maintenance and repairs.​

💡 By tracking the routes these vehicles take and cross-referencing it with vehicle diagnostic data, users can find correlations and develop insights.

## 📝 Design Spec
📍 **Tracker**: sits on the dashboard of the vehicle with a cable connected to the OBD-II port, extracting vehicle diagnostic data and collecting GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope data via onboard sensors.

🗺 **Web App**: an interactive map to track the vehicle location along with a statistics page with a dashboard of KPIs and calculations over historical data.

📡 RF circuitry for LTE and GPS functionality

🔌 Power circuitry to support bench, OBD-II, and microUSB supply

💻 Programmable OPT pins & test points for debugging & flexibility


## 📶 Firmware & Networking
